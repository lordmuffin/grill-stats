## Installation

### HACS Installation (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in your Home Assistant instance
2. Go to "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots in the top right corner
4. Select "Custom repositories"
5. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/lordmuffin/grill-stats`
6. Select "Integration" as the category
7. Click "Add"
8. Find "Grill Monitoring" in the integration list
9. Click "Download"
10. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the `grill_monitoring` folder from this repository
2. Copy it to your `config/custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

Before configuring the integration, ensure you have:

1. **Device Service**: Running at `http://localhost:8080` (or your custom URL)
2. **Temperature Service**: Running at `http://localhost:8081` (or your custom URL)
3. **ThermoWorks API Key**: Configured in your microservices

### Setup via UI

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for "Grill Monitoring"
4. Enter your service URLs:
   - Device Service URL (default: `http://localhost:8080`)
   - Temperature Service URL (default: `http://localhost:8081`)
5. Configure optional settings:
   - **Scan Interval**: How often to update data (10-300 seconds, default: 30)
   - **Timeout**: Request timeout in seconds (5-60 seconds, default: 10)
6. Click **Submit**

The integration will automatically test the connection and discover your devices.

## Entities

The integration creates the following entity types:

### Temperature Sensors
- **Device Temperature**: Main temperature reading for each device
- **Probe Temperature**: Individual temperature readings for multi-probe devices
- **Unit**: Automatically detects Fahrenheit or Celsius
- **Attributes**: Device ID, probe ID, temperature unit, last seen timestamp

### Battery Sensors
- **Battery Level**: Battery percentage for wireless devices
- **Attributes**: Device ID, last seen timestamp

### Signal Strength Sensors
- **Signal Strength**: Wireless signal strength in dBm
- **Attributes**: Device ID, last seen timestamp

## Device Information

Each device appears in Home Assistant with:
- **Name**: Device name from ThermoWorks
- **Manufacturer**: ThermoWorks
- **Model**: Device type
- **Software Version**: Firmware version (if available)
- **Identifiers**: Unique device ID

## Services

The integration provides access to the underlying microservice APIs:

### Available Data
- Real-time temperature readings
- Historical temperature data
- Device health status
- Battery levels and signal strength
- Device configuration and metadata

### API Endpoints
- Device discovery and management
- Current temperature readings
- Historical data queries
- Temperature statistics
- Device health monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Integration not loading:**
- Verify both microservices are running and accessible
- Check the service URLs in the integration configuration
- Review Home Assistant logs for connection errors

**No devices discovered:**
- Ensure ThermoWorks API key is configured in the microservices
- Check device service logs for API connection issues
- Verify devices are registered and active in ThermoWorks

**Temperature data not updating:**
- Check temperature service logs for API errors
- Verify scan interval is appropriate for your setup
- Ensure devices are powered on and connected

**Battery/Signal data missing:**
- Some devices may not report battery or signal data
- Check device health endpoint for available data
- Verify device supports these features

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging by adding to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.grill_monitoring: debug
```

### Service Health

Monitor service health using the built-in health check endpoints:
- Device Service: `http://localhost:8080/health`
- Temperature Service: `http://localhost:8081/health`

## Configuration Examples
