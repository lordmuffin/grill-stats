# Secure CI/CD Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the security improvements made to the CI/CD pipeline for the Grill Stats project. The implementation provides a comprehensive approach to managing sensitive information throughout the CI/CD process, enhancing credential management for Docker registry authentication and other sensitive data by removing hardcoded credentials and implementing a more secure approach using repository secrets.

## Security Improvements

1. **Removal of Hardcoded Credentials**
   - Removed exposed Docker Hub credentials from all workflow files
   - Implemented secure credential handling using repository secrets
   - Extended to cover all sensitive data (API keys, database credentials, etc.)

2. **Secret Management**
   - Created a standardized approach for using repository secrets
   - Added validation to ensure secrets are properly configured
   - Implemented comprehensive documentation on secret management
   - Integrated with existing 1Password Connect system for runtime secrets

3. **Maintenance Tools**
   - Created scripts for setting up and testing the secret management implementation
   - Implemented a credential rotation plan with scripts
   - Added comprehensive documentation for ongoing maintenance
   - Developed test framework for validating secret management implementation

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

1. **Workflow File Updates**
   - Created new secure workflow file `/.gitea/workflows/secure-build.yaml`
   - Removed hardcoded credential values from all workflow files
   - Added proper environment variable configuration for secrets
   - Implemented validation to check for secret availability
   - Added security scanning job for vulnerability detection
   - Enhanced test job with proper secret handling

2. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive `docs/ci-cd-secret-management.md` guide
   - Added detailed instructions for setting up and managing secrets
   - Documented secret rotation procedures and schedules
   - Included troubleshooting guide for common issues

3. **Scripts**
   - `scripts/setup-ci-cd-secrets.sh`: Complete script for setting up Gitea repository secrets
   - `scripts/test-ci-cd-secrets.sh`: Test script for validating secret management implementation

## Required Actions

### 1. Setup CI/CD Secrets

Before running any CI/CD pipelines, repository administrators must set up the required secrets:

1. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-ci-cd-secrets.sh --gitea-url https://your-gitea-instance.com --gitea-token YOUR_TOKEN --repository owner/repo
   ```

2. The script will prompt for necessary credentials and set up all required secrets:
   - Docker Hub authentication (`DOCKER_AUTH`)
   - ThermoWorks API key (`THERMOWORKS_API_KEY`)
   - Home Assistant credentials (`HOMEASSISTANT_URL`, `HOMEASSISTANT_TOKEN`)
   - Database credentials (PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, Redis)
   - Application secrets (`SECRET_KEY`)

### 2. Revoke Exposed Credentials

Any previously hardcoded credentials must be revoked:

1. Log in to each service (Docker Hub, ThermoWorks, Home Assistant, etc.)
2. Revoke any exposed credentials
3. Create new tokens with minimal permissions

### 3. Test the CI/CD Pipeline

After setting up the secrets:

1. Run the test script to validate the implementation:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-ci-cd-secrets.sh --gitea-url https://your-gitea-instance.com --gitea-token YOUR_TOKEN --repository owner/repo
   ```

2. Make a small change to trigger the CI/CD pipeline
3. Verify that the builds succeed with the new secret management

## Security Best Practices

For ongoing secret management:

1. **Use Tokens Instead of Passwords**
   - Create service-specific tokens with minimal permissions
   - Set expiration dates on all tokens
   - Use different tokens for different environments

2. **Regular Rotation**
   - Rotate high-value secrets (Docker Hub, API keys) every 30-90 days
   - Rotate service accounts every 180 days
   - Rotate project-specific tokens at least annually

3. **Access Control**
   - Limit who has access to create and manage secrets
   - Use role-based access control for repository access
   - Implement principle of least privilege for all credentials

4. **Monitoring**
   - Regularly check CI/CD logs for credential issues
   - Monitor service access logs for unusual activity
   - Set up alerts for security events

## Verification

To verify the secure implementation:

1. Run the test script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-ci-cd-secrets.sh --gitea-url https://your-gitea-instance.com --gitea-token YOUR_TOKEN --repository owner/repo
   ```

2. Check for any remaining hardcoded credentials:
   ```bash
   grep -r "secrets\." --include="*.yaml" ./.gitea/workflows/
   ```

3. Validate workflow files:
   ```bash
   # For each workflow file
   yamllint ./.gitea/workflows/*.yaml
   ```

4. Test the workflow manually:
   ```bash
   # Make a small change and push to trigger the workflow
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Test CI/CD secrets" && git push
   ```
