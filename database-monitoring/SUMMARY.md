# Database Monitoring Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of database monitoring and alerting for the Grill Stats platform. The monitoring stack provides comprehensive visibility into the health, performance, and operational metrics for all database services: PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, and Redis.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Prometheus Exporters

- **PostgreSQL Exporter**: Collects metrics from PostgreSQL, including connection counts, database sizes, query performance, and custom application metrics.
- **InfluxDB Exporter**: Leverages InfluxDB's built-in metrics endpoint to gather time-series database metrics.
- **Redis Exporter**: Collects Redis metrics with custom LUA scripts to extract application-specific queue metrics and cache statistics.

### 2. Alerting Rules

Created comprehensive alerting rules for all database services:

- **PostgreSQL Alerts**: Availability, replication lag, connection limits, idle transactions, lock counts, and application-specific metrics.
- **InfluxDB Alerts**: Query response time, write performance, memory usage, and temperature reading metrics.
- **Redis Alerts**: Memory usage, connection limits, replication health, persistence errors, and application queue backlogs.

### 3. Grafana Dashboards

Developed detailed dashboards for each database:

- **PostgreSQL Dashboard**: Shows database status, connections, replication lag, database sizes, and device health metrics.
- **InfluxDB Dashboard**: Displays query performance, write metrics, temperature readings, and data collection statistics.
- **Redis Dashboard**: Visualizes memory usage, connected clients, cache hit rates, queue lengths, and application-specific metrics.

### 4. Local Development Environment

Created a docker-compose configuration for local development monitoring:

- Includes Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, and all exporters.
- Automatically provisioned data sources and dashboards.
- Configurable alert notification channels (email, Slack).

### 5. Production Kubernetes Manifests

Prepared Kubernetes manifests for production deployment:

- Proper resource limits and requests.
- Persistent volume claims for data storage.
- RBAC configuration for secure deployment.
- ConfigMaps for configuration management.
- Readiness/liveness probes for health monitoring.
- Split multi-document YAML files into single-document files to pass validation checks.

## Benefits

1. **Early Problem Detection**: Alerts trigger before issues impact users.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Metrics help identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
3. **Capacity Planning**: Trends reveal when to scale database resources.
4. **Application Insights**: Custom metrics provide business-level visibility into device health and temperature data.
5. **Operational Visibility**: Comprehensive dashboards give operators a clear view of system health.

## Next Steps

1. **Integration Testing**: Test monitoring in development environment.
2. **Alert Tuning**: Adjust thresholds based on observed patterns.
3. **Runbook Documentation**: Create response procedures for each alert.
4. **User Training**: Train operations team on dashboard usage and alert response.
5. **Extended Metrics**: Add more application-specific metrics as the system evolves.
6. **Connection Pooling**: Implement and monitor database connection pooling.

## Conclusion

The implemented monitoring solution provides comprehensive visibility into all database systems, with appropriate alerting and visualization tools. This infrastructure is critical for maintaining reliable database operations and ensuring optimal application performance.
