# Multi-Agent Grill Monitoring Implementation Plan

## Architecture Analysis & Agent Responsibilities

### Current State Analysis
The existing grill-stats application is a monolithic Flask application with the following components:
- **Flask API Layer**: REST endpoints for device management and temperature data
- **ThermoWorks Integration**: API client for device discovery and temperature readings
- **Home Assistant Integration**: Sensor creation and state management
- **Background Processing**: APScheduler for 5-minute sync intervals
- **Basic CI/CD**: Gitea Actions with Docker build and flake8 linting

### Proposed Microservices Architecture

#### 1. **API Gateway Service** (Entry Point)
- **Purpose**: Central API entry point and routing
- **Responsibilities**: Request routing, authentication, rate limiting
- **Technology**: Kong or Nginx with authentication middleware
- **Endpoints**: All external API access routes through this service

#### 2. **Device Management Service**
- **Purpose**: ThermoWorks device discovery and management
- **Responsibilities**: Device registration, configuration, health monitoring
- **Current Code**: Extract from `thermoworks_client.py:get_devices()`
- **Database**: Device registry with configuration and metadata

#### 3. **Temperature Data Service**
- **Purpose**: Real-time temperature data collection and processing
- **Responsibilities**: Temperature reading, data validation, real-time streaming
- **Current Code**: Extract from `thermoworks_client.py:get_temperature_data()`
- **Database**: Time-series database (InfluxDB or TimescaleDB)

#### 4. **Home Assistant Integration Service**
- **Purpose**: Home Assistant sensor management and state synchronization
- **Responsibilities**: Sensor creation, state updates, notification management
- **Current Code**: Extract from `homeassistant_client.py`
- **Integration**: REST API and WebSocket connections to Home Assistant

#### 5. **Data Processing Service**
- **Purpose**: Data aggregation, historical analysis, and alerting
- **Responsibilities**: Data transformation, trend analysis, alert generation
- **Current Code**: Extract from `app.py:sync_temperature_data()`
- **Processing**: Stream processing with Apache Kafka or Redis Streams

#### 6. **Notification Service**
- **Purpose**: Alert management and multi-channel notifications
- **Responsibilities**: Alert routing, notification delivery, escalation
- **Integration**: Email, SMS, push notifications, Home Assistant notifications
