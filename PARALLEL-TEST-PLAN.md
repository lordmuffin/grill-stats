# Parallelized Production Testing Plan for grill-stats.lab.apj.dev

This document outlines a parallelized approach to testing the Grill-Stats application in the production environment at grill-stats.lab.apj.dev.

## Test Tracks Overview

We've organized testing into five parallel tracks that can be executed simultaneously by different agents. Each track is designed to minimize dependencies between parallel test efforts.

## Track 1: API & Core Functionality
**Agent 1**

### Pre-Deployment Verification
- Verify connectivity to production environment at grill-stats.lab.apj.dev
- Check Flask application startup and health endpoint (`GET /health`)
- Verify environment variables configuration

### API Endpoint Testing
- Test all REST API endpoints:
  - `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
  - `GET /devices` - Device listing
  - `GET /devices/{id}/temperature` - Current temperature
  - `GET /devices/{id}/history` - Historical data
  - `POST /sync` - Manual sync trigger
  - `GET /homeassistant/test` - HA connection test
- Document response times and payload structures

## Track 2: ThermoWorks Integration
**Agent 2**

### Authentication & Device Discovery
- Test OAuth2 authentication with ThermoWorks API
  - Verify authorization code flow
  - Test token refresh mechanism
  - Validate connection status tracking
- Test device discovery functionality
  - Verify all device models are detected correctly
  - Confirm proper firmware version detection
  - Validate multi-probe support

### Temperature Data Collection
- Test multi-probe temperature data collection
  - Verify individual probe tracking
  - Validate probe type detection
  - Test automatic probe configuration
- Validate configurable polling functionality
  - Test different polling intervals
  - Confirm error recovery mechanisms
- Test data validation mechanisms
  - Verify out-of-range detection
  - Test disconnected probe identification

## Track 3: Home Assistant Integration & Data Storage
**Agent 3**

### Home Assistant Integration
- Test automatic sensor creation
  - Verify temperature sensors with proper device classes
  - Validate battery and signal strength sensors
  - Test connection status sensors
- Verify entity naming compliance
  - Test Home Assistant naming conventions
  - Verify proper categorization and grouping
- Test state synchronization
  - Verify bidirectional state updates
  - Test attribute updates with metadata
  - Validate handling of Home Assistant restarts

### Data Storage Testing
- Test InfluxDB integration
  - Verify data schema and point compression
  - Validate tag-based metadata storage
  - Test query performance
- Verify retention policies
  - Test data retention at different resolutions
- Test Redis caching layer
  - Verify in-memory caching performance
  - Test TTL-based cache invalidation
  - Validate real-time data streaming

## Track 4: Performance & Reliability
**Agent 4**

### Load Testing
- Test system under normal load conditions
  - 10 concurrent devices with 5-minute polling
  - Regular API requests from multiple clients
- Test system under peak load conditions
  - 50+ concurrent devices with 30-second polling
  - Heavy API request traffic
- Measure and document response times under various loads

### Reliability Testing
- Test long-running stability (12+ hours, expandable to 72+ hours)
  - Monitor for memory leaks
  - Verify consistent data collection
  - Test automatic recovery after network interruptions
- Test failure recovery scenarios
  - ThermoWorks API unavailability
  - Home Assistant instance restart
  - Database connection interruptions

## Track 5: Security, Deployment & UI
**Agent 5**

### Security Testing
- Test API key security for ThermoWorks
  - Verify secure storage
  - Test token refresh mechanisms
- Test Home Assistant token security
  - Verify least privilege principle
  - Test token expiration handling
- Verify secure handling of credentials
  - Test environment variable protection
  - Validate secrets management
- Test network security
  - Verify TLS for all external communications

### Web UI & Mobile Support
- Test real-time dashboard functionality
  - Verify multiple device support
  - Test real-time temperature charts
- Test device management interface
  - Verify device discovery and configuration
  - Test probe labeling and customization
- Test responsive design
  - Verify mobile-optimized layouts
  - Test touch-friendly controls
  - Validate offline support

### Deployment Verification
- Verify Docker container deployment
  - Validate container networking
  - Test volume mounting for configurations
  - Verify port mapping and exposure
- If applicable, verify Kubernetes deployment
  - Validate database operators
  - Test messaging system
  - Verify ingress configuration

## Dependency Chain & Coordination Points

The following tests have dependencies that require coordination between agents:

1. **ThermoWorks Device Discovery → Home Assistant Sensor Creation**
   - Agent 2 should complete device discovery before Agent 3 tests sensor creation
   - Coordination Point: Share discovered device IDs

2. **Data Collection → Data Storage Testing**
   - Agent 2 should collect temperature data before Agent 3 tests data storage
   - Coordination Point: Confirm data has been collected

3. **Load Testing → UI Testing**
   - Agent 4 and Agent 5 should coordinate when running performance tests
   - Coordination Point: Schedule UI testing outside of peak load testing

## Final Integration Testing
**All Agents**

After individual tracks are completed, all agents should participate in a final integration test to ensure all components work together properly:

1. Verify end-to-end flow from ThermoWorks device → Data storage → Home Assistant → UI
2. Validate the system's response to various operational scenarios
3. Complete the Final Approval Checklist collectively

## Rollback Plan

Should critical issues be discovered during testing, a rollback plan should be executed:

- Document all issues discovered
- Categorize by severity
- Implement fix or revert to previous version
- Verify application state after rollback
- Test data integrity after rollback

## Reporting Structure

Each agent should document their findings in a standardized format:
- Test name
- Status (Pass/Fail/Partial)
- Issue description (if applicable)
- Screenshots/logs
- Recommendations

## Testing Timeline

- Estimated time for each track: 4-8 hours
- Total parallelized testing time: 1-2 days
- Final integration testing: 4 hours

## Communication Channel

Agents should use a dedicated communication channel to coordinate testing efforts and report findings in real-time.
